==================PORT SCANNER LITE BETA(CMDLINE VERSION 1.0b)
this is a  networking tool that was written exclusively in python to scan open ports on socket connections. It uses the IP4 socket family(AF_SOCKET) and the SOCKET_STREAM method. Both of which are python's builtins.
- Note that when entering a web address, you should include the connection protocol type. For Example, instead of just entering 'google.com', you should enter http://google.com or 'https://google.com'. Including the www subdomain also works, as in 'www.google.com'. If you leave out the protocol method, the program wont work. But will fix this issue in the next release. Stay tuned!!!
- the port range is between 1 and 1024. For a larger port version stay tuned for the next stable release.
